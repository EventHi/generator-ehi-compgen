This package is used internally at the EventHi team to generate boilerplate for new React components. This is available in both function and class forms.


## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-ehi-docgen using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-ehi-compgen
```

Then generate your new component:

```bash
yo ehi-docgen # for stateless component
yo ehi-docgen:class # for es6 class component
```
